        <p>
            <strong>Traditional Ecuadorian</strong> dish made with braised pork, 
            typically served with potato tortillas, boiled potatoes, 
            cooked corn, pickled onions, and fried plantains. 
            <strong>The pork</strong> is cooked in a flavorful liquid, then fried in its own 
            rendered fat until browned and caramelized.
